        this is basically reading a file and printing its contents

    makewords command: 
        once the file has been read the program is going to use a
        second buffer where only [azAZ09] characters are going to
        be stored, anything else is taken as a separator bwtween
        words
    
    lowercase command:
        once the file has been read, the program will look for characters
        between [AZ], once it founds them will turn them into lower by
        subtracting 32 to the byte, all other bytes and transformed ones
        are stored into a second buffer
    
    sort command:
        Ok, this command actually does something different, the first thing
        to do is getting all words within a fixed array in width, what i mean
        is this: When you read a file your buffer will look like:

        hi\n                hi   \n
        como\n              como \n
        estas\n             estas\n
        ~~~~~~~ this        `~~~~~~~~~ but we want this

        Once we have the second version in a separated buffer we apply Quick
        sort (The comparation funcion is via ascii value); whenever we have
        to do a swap byte by byte without any additional variable i love asm
